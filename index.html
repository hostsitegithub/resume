      to
      my website. A little something about myself: I am an Aerospace
      Engineer and have earned my Undergraduate Degree (B.Tech. Honours) from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I have always envisaged myself engaged in Engineering Operations as a part of an
      organization which is coherent with my personal values of Excellence and Integrity. Desirous of such an occupation, I garnered competence in General Engineering and Management, Aircraft Design, Aerodynamics, Structures, Gas Turbine Engines,
      Structures and Flight Controls during my college days.<br><br><br>After graduating, I wanted to dabble in Manufacturing Operations to enhance my Engineering versatility and Leadership skills. Subsequently, I joined Rolls-Royce in the capacity
      of a Manufacturing Engineer where I contributed to the Process Planning of Turbine Discs commodity. I was deputed to Germany to gain a thorough understanding of relevant technology and to facilitate liaison between India and Germany. I was
      handpicked for leading Capital Manufacturing Technology Projects and I proceeded to function as a Project Manager for deployment of the same. I have managed a portfolio of 3 Manufacturing Projects entailing stakeholder management, project
      finances, schedules, business requirements, technology approval, operations, systems, supply chain, quality and executive reporting & communications. I presently am positioned as an Engineering Analyst with Infosys / Rolls-Royce
      partnership where I drive BiQ and TQM initiatives for HP Turbine NGVs. I also offer a sound understanding of Business Strategies (Porterâ€™s 5 Forces, 4P models, Industry Categorization etc.), Financial & Economic Terminologies and expertise in
      Lean Manufacturing, TQM, PFMEA, Statistical Process Analysis, Problem Solving, GD&T & Web Development.</p>
